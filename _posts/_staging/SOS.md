Am I writer if I don't write? Am I writer if I can't think of anything to write about? Am I a writer? 


The act of writing became tantamount to my existence; I think therefore I write, so clearly I must be a pretty interesting guy. 

Indeed, those early years were a cry for validation. I'm lucky that I found an audience who was happy to do their part. Unfortunately, I hadn't yet learned the value of discipline and rigor, so my posts were sporadic in wait of the ever evasive "inspiration". After a few years the gaps between my  words grew beyond the life of Xanga. 

A few years later, I spun up a new blog with WordPress. I took this one far more seriously, posting two and eventually three times a week. I credit this time for being when I discovered my "voice". The blog was called "Hunting for God", and it documented my attempts at trying to meet with the Almighty. More than a how-to guide, it was a series of missives as I tried to navigate my life with a still developing understanding of how I believed the universe worked. Five years after it started, it felt like it was time to say goodbye. My pursuit of God had flung me headlong into heresy, and I was no longer sure  of what I was hunting. 

In 2017 a yoga studio opened in town. I was tangentially connected to one of the instructors, and she gave me a heads up that there was going to be a program starting that focused on the spiritual aspects of yoga. I was deeply intrigued and signed up immediately. The time felt right, so I started a new blog called, "Paul on the Path". Similar to Hunting for God, my posts explored the material I was working through and how it was affecting how I perceived the world.
