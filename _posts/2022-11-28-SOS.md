From the halcyon days of seeking validation on Xanga, to the exploration of discipline that came from posting consistently to WordPress, and finally growing frustrated at having no real control of my words on Facebook, I have been slinging words across the internet for twenty years. 

I'm not sure how it happened. One day I was just living my life, the next I created something called a "blog" and suddenly my inner monologue found an escape hatch.  Freed from the confines of my skull, it was free to parkour across the page. I had no way of knowing that the way in which I related to the world had irrevocably been changed. That was the moment I became a writer. 

The following twenty years would see me question that label over and over again... and yet, here I am, writing yet another blog post. In the past my blogs were thematic. "Hunting for God", the WordPress blog in which I posted my attempts at knowing the Almighty. When my pursuit of god flung me headlong into heresy, I started "Paul on the Path", the Facebook page where I posted my amblings through self-love and new age spirituality. 

And now? 

I'm not hunting for God. The path has washed out. 

I am adrift. Trying to find purpose amongst spirituality, technology, and modern life.
